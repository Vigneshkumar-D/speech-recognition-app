- **Transcription Display:** The app displays the transcribed text in real-time as speech recognition progresses.
- **Submit Transcription:** Users can submit the transcription data to the backend for processing.
- **Download Transcripts:** Transcripts can be downloaded as an Excel file for offline use.

## Technologies Used
